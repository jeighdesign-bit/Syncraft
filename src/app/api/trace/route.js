CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - STRICT 1:1 REPLICATION:
- DO NOT REDRAW OR REINTERPRET: You are strictly forbidden from changing the shape, style, or layout of ANY element. 
- 100% EXACT ACCURACY: You must output a mathematically exact replica of the input image, just cleaner and higher resolution. 

TYPOGRAPHY & METALLIC/3D EFFECTS:
- EXACT FONT PRESERVATION: Never change the font. Preserve every single stylized edge, cut, and serif of the text exactly as shown (e.g. SQUAD ESPORTS).
- PRESERVE REFLECTIONS & GRADIENTS: If the text or mascot has a metallic reflection, 3D bevel, chrome effect, or complex gradient, YOU MUST COPY THE GRADIENT EXACTLY. DO NOT flatten it into ugly solid gray blocks.

CLEAN UP (YOUR ONLY ALLOWED CHANGES):
- ZERO BACKGROUND: Remove any real-world background (table, paper, fabric, noisy textures). Make the background pure solid or transparent.
- UNWARP SLANTED PHOTOS: If the photo is taken at a slanted angle, unwarp it so the logo is perfectly flat and symmetrical.
- REMOVE NOISE: Remove jpeg compression artifacts, camera blur, and speckles. Keep shapes razor-sharp.

WHAT FAILURE LOOKS LIKE (AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS):
❌ Replacing stylized text with generic fonts or gibberish.
❌ Flattening beautiful metallic/3D gradients into ugly solid gray blocks.
❌ Changing the shape of mascot feathers, eyes, or outlines.
❌ Hallucinating or redrawing the design differently than the original.

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
✅ A 1:1 exact pixel-perfect HD restoration of the original logo.
✅ All metallic reflections, gradients, and stylized fonts are perfectly preserved.

WOW-FACTOR & PREMIUM AESTHETICS (CRITICAL FOR OUTPUT QUALITY):
- HYPER-CRISP VECTOR-LIKE EDGES: Ensure all lines, shapes, and borders are razor-sharp with zero blur. It must look like a meticulously crafted vector file.
- VIBRANT, STRIKING COLORS: Enhance the color palette to be rich, deeply saturated, and highly contrasted. Make the colors POP intensely while staying true to the original hues.
- PROFESSIONAL STUDIO FINISH: The final image must look like a breathtaking, top-tier premium esports/corporate logo. Apply a flawless, high-definition polish that makes the user say "WOW!" instantly upon seeing it. Do not just clean it; make it visually spectacular and incredibly premium.`;

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - AVOID THE SHIRT SHAPE:

- FULL BLEED PATTERN: The output MUST be a perfect, solid rectangular canvas filled edge-to-edge with the background pattern and design elements. Extend all lines, shapes, and textures infinitely to the borders of the rectangular image.

SURGICAL TEXT AND LOGO REMOVAL (MANDATORY):
- Identify and SURGICALLY ERASE all typography, text, numbers, sponsors, chest logos, and watermarks. NO TEXT OR LOGOS ARE ALLOWED.
- FLAWLESS RECONSTRUCTION: After erasing the text/logo, you MUST flawlessly reconstruct the underlying background pattern to fill the gap. A human should not be able to tell where the text used to be. It must be 98% accurate to the original pattern colors and shapes.

CLEAN VECTOR-LIKE AESTHETICS (NO NOISE/DOTS):
- SOLID COLORS ONLY: Convert all messy, pixelated, or noisy textures into clean, solid, flat colors.
- NO HALFTONES OR SPECKLES: Completely eliminate any "dot patterns" (puntik-puntik), camera noise, artifacts, or print speckles.
- FLATTEN THE FABRIC: Erase all 3D fabric folds, wrinkles, shadows, camera highlights, and cloth textures while keeping the artwork perfectly flat.

WHAT FAILURE LOOKS LIKE (AVOID THESE):
❌ The output looks like the shape of a shirt, torso, or garment.
❌ Any text, numbers, names, or logos remaining in the final image.
❌ Blurry smudges where the text used to be (must be perfectly reconstructed pattern).
❌ Noisy dot patterns, speckles, or muddy textures.
